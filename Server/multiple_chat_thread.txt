Print all the threads chat groups
Prompt user for the thread number to join
Error handle the option that was chosen


STORE THE USERS FOR EACH THREAD:
The threads will each be assigned an index in an array for each thread
When the user chooses that thread to join then the sockfd struct of the 
user will also be attached to the thread in a form of a linked list; it 
will be a linked list of struct.

The problem is that there will be a copy of the structs. Instead perhaps 
a list of pointers to the structs within the "main" array of all loggedin 
users? When the user logs out then that struct-pointer is removed from the 
linked list.

Also, a function to remove the loggedin structs from the arrays and linked 
lists when the user logs out or when they press CTRL-C
